## ✅ Why This Feature Is a Game-Changer

| ⚠️ Problem on Other Platforms       | 🚀 XploreNow's Follow System Solution              |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Agencies feel disconnected         | Users follow agencies for updates and trust        |
| No loyalty or repeat bookings      | Users get notified about offers and new treks      |
| No engagement beyond booking       | Agencies build a community, like Instagram         |
| Small agencies struggle to grow    | Followers = loyal, recurring audience              |
